<section id="abstract">
  <p>This primer is designed to provide the reader with the basic
  knowledge required to effectively use RDF. It introduces the basic
  concepts of RDF and shows concrete examples of the use of RDF.
  Secs. 3-5 can be used as a minimalist introduction into the key
  elements of RDF. Changes between RDF 1.1
  and RDF 1.2 are summarized in a separate document: [[[RDF12-NEW]]] [[RDF12-NEW]].</p>

<section id="sotd">
  <p>This document is part of the RDF 1.2 document suite. It is an
  informative note on the key concepts of RDF. For a normative
  specification of RDF 1.2 the reader is referred to the [[[RDF12-CONCEPTS]]] document
  [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]].</p>

<section id="section-Introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for
  expressing information about
  <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#resources-and-statements">
  resources</a>.
  Resources
  can be anything, including documents, people, physical objects, and abstract
  concepts.</p>

  <p>RDF is intended for situations in which information on the Web needs to
  be processed by applications, rather than being only displayed to
  people. RDF provides a common framework for expressing this
  information so it can be exchanged between applications without
  loss of meaning. Since it is a common framework, application
  designers can leverage the availability of common RDF parsers and
  processing tools. The ability to exchange information between
  different applications means that the information may be made
  available to applications other than those for which it was
  originally created. </p>

  <p>In particular RDF can be used to publish and interlink data on the Web.
  For example, retrieving <code>http://www.example.org/bob#me</code>
  could provide data about Bob, including the fact that he
  knows Alice, as identified by her IRI (an IRI is an "Internationalized
  Resource Identifier"; see <a href="#section-IRI" class="sectionRef"></a> for details).
  Retrieving Alice's IRI could then provide more data about her, including links
  to other datasets for her friends, interests, etc. A person or
  an automated process can then follow such links and aggregate data about these
  various things. Such uses of RDF are often
  qualified as Linked Data [[LINKED-DATA]]. </p>

  <p>This document is not normative and does not give a complete
  account of RDF 1.2. Normative
  specifications of RDF can be found in the following documents: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A document describing the basic concepts underlying RDF, as
    well as abstract syntax ("RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax")
    [[RDF12-CONCEPTS]]</li>
    <li>A document describing the formal model-theoretic semantics
    of RDF ("RDF Semantics") [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]</li>
    <li>Specifications of serialization formats for RDF:

<section id="section-use-cases">
  <h2>Why Use RDF?</h2>

  <p>The following illustrates various different uses of RDF, aimed
  at different communities of practice.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Adding machine-readable information to Web pages using, for example,
      the popular <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>
      vocabulary, enabling them to be displayed
      in an enhanced format on search engines or to be processed automatically
      by third-party applications.</li>
    <li>Enriching a dataset by linking it to third-party
      datasets. For example, a dataset about
      paintings could be enriched by linking them to the corresponding
      artists in <a href="https://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>,
      therefore giving access to a wide range of information about
      them and related resources.</li>
    <li>Interlinking API feeds, making sure that clients can easily
      discover how to access more information.</li>
      <li>Using the datasets currently published as Linked Data
      [[LINKED-DATA]], for example
      building aggregations of data around specific topics.</li>
    <li>Building distributed social networks by interlinking RDF
      descriptions of people
      across multiple Web sites.</li>
      <li>Providing a standards-compliant way for exchanging data
      between databases.</li>
    <li>Interlinking various datasets within an organisation,
      enabling cross-dataset queries to
      be performed using SPARQL [[SPARQL12-CONCEPTS]].</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>RDF Data Model</h2>

  <section id="section-triple">
    <h3>Triples</h3>

    <p>RDF allows us to make statements about resources.
    The format of these statements is simple. A statement always
    has the following structure:<p>

   <pre>
      &lt;subject&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt;
    </pre>

    <!--
    <p>The <strong>subject</strong> represents the resource we like to
    make a statement about. The <strong>predicate</strong> represents
    a property of the subject. The
    <strong>object</strong> represents a value of the property
    for this subject. Because RDF statements consist of three elements they are called
    <strong>triples</strong>.</p>
    -->

    <p>An RDF statement expresses a relationship between two resources.
    The <strong>subject</strong> and the <strong>object</strong>
    represent the two resources being
    related; the <strong>predicate</strong> represents the nature of their
    relationship. The relationship is phrased in  a directional way
    (from subject to object) and is called in RDF a
    <strong>property</strong>.  Because RDF statements consist of
    three elements they are called <strong>triples</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Here are examples of RDF triples (informally expressed in pseudocode):</p>

    <pre class="example" title="Sample triples (informal)" id="example1">
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is a&gt; &lt;person&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is a friend of&gt; &lt;Alice&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is born on&gt; &lt;the 4th of July 1990&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is interested in&gt; &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;.
      &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt; &lt;was created by&gt; &lt;Leonardo da Vinci&gt;.
      &lt;the video 'La Joconde à Washington'&gt; &lt;is about&gt; &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;.
    </pre>

    <p>The same resource is often referenced in multiple triples. In the example above,
    Bob is the subject of four triples, and the Mona Lisa is the subject of
    one and the object of two triples. This ability to have the same resource be
    in the subject position of one triple and the object position of another
    makes it possible to find connections between triples, which is an
    important part of RDF's power.</p>

    <p>A set of triples is called a <strong>graph</strong>.
    We can visualize a set of triples as a connected graph.
    Graphs consist of nodes and arcs. The subjects and
    objects of the triples make up the nodes in the graph; the
    predicates form the arcs. <a href="#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>
    shows the graph resulting from the sample triples.</p>

    <figure id="fig1">
      <img class="graph" src="example-graph.jpg"
                alt="Informal graphs of the sample triples">
      <figcaption>Informal graph of the sample triples</figcaption>
    </figure>

   <p>Once you have a graph like this you can use SPARQL [[SPARQL12-CONCEPTS]] to
    query for e.g. people interested in paintings by Leonardo da
    Vinci.</p>

    <p>The RDF Data Model is described in this section
    in the form of an "abstract syntax", i.e. a data model that is independent of a
    particular concrete syntax (the syntax used to represent triples stored in
    text files).  Different concrete syntaxes may
    produce exactly the same graph from the perspective of the
    abstract syntax. The semantics of RDF graphs [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] are defined in
    terms of this abstract syntax. Concrete RDF syntax is introduced
    later in <a href="#section-graph-syntax" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

    <p>In the next four subsections, we discuss the four kinds of
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-term">RDF term</a>
    that occur in triples: IRIs, literals, blank nodes, and triple terms. </p>

  </section>

  <section id="section-IRI">
    <h3>IRIs</h3>

    <p>The abbreviation IRI is short for "Internationalized Resource
    Identifier". An <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-iri">IRI</a>
    identifies a resource. The URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) that
    people use as Web addresses are one form of IRI. Other forms of IRI
    provide an identifier for a resource without implying its location
    or how to access it. The notion of IRI is a
    generalization of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), allowing
    non-ASCII characters to be used in the IRI character string. IRIs are specified
    in RFC 3987 [[RFC3987]].

    <p>IRIs can appear in <strong>all three positions</strong> of a triple. </p>

    <p>As mentioned, IRIs are used to identify resources such as documents,
    people, physical objects, and abstract concepts.
    For example, the IRI for Leonardo da Vinci in <a
    href="https://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a> is:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="IRI for Leonardo da Vinci">
      <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci">http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci</a>
    </pre>

    <p>The IRI for an <a href="https://www.ina.fr">INA</a> video about the Mona Lisa entitled 'La Joconde à Washington' in <a href="https://www.europeana.eu">Europeana</a> is:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="IRI for video about the Mona Lisa">
      <a href="http://data.europeana.eu/item/04802/243FA8618938F4117025F17A8B813C5F9AA4D619">http://data.europeana.eu/item/04802/243FA8618938F4117025F17A8B813C5F9AA4D619</a>
    </pre>

    <p>IRIs are global identifiers, so other people can re-use this
    IRI to identify the same thing. For example, the following IRI is
    used by many people as an RDF property to state an acquaintance
    relationship between people:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="IRI for foaf:knows">
      <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows</a>
    </pre>

    <p>RDF is agnostic about what the IRI represents. However,
    IRIs may be given meaning by particular vocabularies or
    conventions. For example,
    <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/Datasets#h338-3">DBpedia</a> uses IRIs of the form
    <code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Name</code> to denote the thing
    described by the corresponding Wikipedia article.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="section-literal">

    <h3>Literals</h3>

    <p><a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-literal">Literals</a>
    are used to encode values, rather than identifying them by IRIs. Examples
    of literals include strings such as `"La Joconde"`, dates formatted
    according to ISO-8601 such as `1990-07-04`, and numbers such as `3.14159`.
    Literals are always associated with a
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-datatype">datatype</a>, enabling them to
    be parsed and interpreted correctly.</p>

    <p>Strings can optionally be associated with a <a
        data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-language-tag">language tag</a>;
    for example, to clarify that the name "Leonardo da Vinci" is the English
    version of his name, the string can be associated with the <code>en</code>
    language tag, "Léonard de Vinci" with the <code>fr</code> language tag (French),
    and "李奥纳多·达·文西" with the <code>zh</code> language tag (Chinese).
    Such literals are called
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-language-tagged-string">language-tagged strings</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Strings may also optionally be associated with an initial <a>base
    direction</a>, with a value of either <code>ltr</code> or <code>rtl</code>
    (for left-to-right and right-to-left, respectively); for example, the English
    title <q lang="en" dir="ltr">HTML &amp; CSS: Designing and Creating Websites</q>,
    associated with the <code>en</code> language tag and recognized as written
    from left to right, would in an Arabic translation be written from right to
    left, as:
    <q lang="ar" dir="rtl">HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب</q>,
    when associated with the <code>ar</code> language tag and the
    <code>rtl</code> initial text direction. Such literals are called
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-dir-lang-string">directional language-tagged strings</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="note">Base direction is used to assist in
    [=Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm|BIDI=] [[?I18N-Glossary]] processing.
    Without the initial base direction, the example title above would incorrectly render
    as:
    <q lang="ar">HTML و CSS: تصميم و إنشاء مواقع الويب</q>.
    This is due to the left-to-right directionality of the initial characters
    in the encoded form, which precede the Arabic letters subsequently
    recognised as right-to-left by the BIDI algorithm. More examples can be
    found in the article
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articles/lang-bidi-use-cases/"
      >Use cases for bidi and language metadata on the Web</a>.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p class="note">The 2004 version of RDF contained the notion of a
    "plain literal" with no datatype. This feature has been removed, as the
    distinction between "plain" literals and literals with datatype
    <code>string</code> was confusing. RDF languages such as Turtle allow
    writing of literals without an explicit datatype and treat this
    as syntactic sugar for a <code>string</code>
    datatype. The special datatype
    <code>rdf:langString</code> is assigned to language-tagged
    literals.</p>
    -->

    <p>Literals may only appear in the <strong>object position</strong> of a triple.</p>

    <p>The RDF Concepts document provides a (non-exhaustive)
    <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#section-Datatypes">list of datatypes</a>.
    This includes many datatypes defined by XML Schema, such as string, boolean, integer, decimal and date. </p>
  </section>

  <section id="section-blank-node">
    <h3>Blank nodes</h3>

    <p>IRIs and literals together provide the basic material for
    writing down RDF statements. In addition, it is sometimes handy
    to be able to talk about resources without bothering to use a global
    identifier.  For example, we might want to state that the Mona
    Lisa painting has in its background an unidentified tree which
    we know to be a cypress tree. A resource without a global identifier, such as the
    painting's cypress tree, can be represented in RDF by a <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-blank-node">blank node</a>.
    Blank nodes are like simple variables in algebra;
    they represent some thing without saying what their value is.
    </p>

    <p>Blank nodes can appear in the <strong>subject and object
    position</strong> of a triple. They can be used
    to denote resources without explicitly naming them with an
    IRI.</p>

    <figure id="fig2">
      <img class="graph" src="example-blank-node.jpg"
                alt="Blank node example: cypress tree">
      <figcaption>Informal blank node example: the background of the Mona Lisa depicts
        an unnamed resource that belongs to the class of cypress trees.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <section id="section-triple-terms">
    <h3>Triple terms</h3>

    <p>As the basic unit of description in RDF, a triple states a simple,
    directed relationship between two resources. Sometimes, we need to describe
    more detailed circumstances underlying such relationships. Conceptually, we
    can <em>annotate</em> a statement with something more detailed:</p>

    <figure id="fig3">
      <a href="example-triple-annotation.svg" data-include="example-triple-annotation.svg">
      </a>
      <figcaption>Informal triple annotation example: a concretization of a
      statement described with its own characteristics.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In conjunction with the arc expressing the relationship, the purple
    circle underneath expresses a <a
    data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-reifier">reifier</a>. This is Bob's interest,
    with a type and a date of origin, as a concrete circumstance of the fact
    that Bob is interested in the Mona Lisa.</p>

    <p>Formally, this annotation is composed of four triples:</p>
    <pre class="example nohighlight">
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is interested in> &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt; .
      &lt;Bob's interest> &lt;is a concretization of> <strong>&lt;&lt;&lpar; <small>&lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is interested in> &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;</small> &rpar;&gt;&gt;</strong> .
      &lt;Bob's interest> &lt;is an> &lt;Interest> .
      &lt;Bob's interest> &lt;since> &lt;4th of October 1998> .
    </pre>

    <p>The second triple is called a <a
    data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-reifying-triple">reifying triple</a>, and
    expresses a concretization of the proposition stated by the first triple.
    The object of a reifying triple is a <a
    data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-triple-term">triple term</a>. It denotes the
    proposition itself, as a logical, abstract object identified through its
    constituent subject, predicate, and object components.</p>

    <p>Triple terms may only appear in the <strong>object position</strong>,
    and should be used with the special <em>reifies</em> predicate of reifying
    triples.</p>

    <aside class="note">
    Relationships can always be described as resources, following the
    patterns of <a
    href="https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html"
    >qualified relations</a> or <a
    href="https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/nary-relation.html"
    >N-ary relations</a>, but simple, direct statements are sometimes
    preferred over more complex, granular descriptions. Description
    authors may need to balance directness and completeness.
    Reifying triples is a way of bridging this difference. It enables us
    to describe more concrete circumstances, such as events, relationships or
    tokens in data sources, <em>in relation to</em> the simple statements.
    </aside>
    <aside class="note">
    Triple terms are used to <em>relate</em> to propositions, not to state
    them. This means that we can describe statements without implying them.
    This is useful for describing unknown propositions, such as suggestions
    or disputed claims.
    We can also annotate statements with multiple reifiers, to describe
    different circumstances varying in time, location, etc.
    </aside>
  </section>

  <section id="section-multiple-graphs">
    <h3>Multiple graphs</h3>

    <p>RDF provides a mechanism to group RDF statements in multiple
    graphs and associate such graphs with an IRI . Multiple graphs are a recent extension of the RDF
    data model. In practice, RDF tool builders and data managers
    needed a mechanism to talk about subsets of a collection of
    triples. Multiple graphs were first introduced in the RDF query
    language SPARQL. The RDF data model was therefore extended with a notion of
    multiple graphs that is closely aligned with SPARQL.</p>

    <p>Multiple graphs in
    an RDF document constitute an <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-rdf-dataset">RDF dataset</a>.
    An RDF dataset may have multiple named graphs and
    at most one unnamed ("default") graph. </p>

    <p>For example, the
    statements in <a href="#example1">Example&nbsp;1</a>
    could be grouped in two named
    graphs. A first graph could be provided by a social networking
    site and identified by <code>http://example.org/bob</code>:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="First graph in the sample dataset">
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is a&gt; &lt;person&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is a friend of&gt; &lt;Alice&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is born on&gt; &lt;the 4th of July 1990&gt;.
      &lt;Bob&gt; &lt;is interested in&gt; &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;.
    </pre>

    <p>The IRI associated with the graph is
    called the <a data-cite="RDF12-CONCEPTS#dfn-graph-name">graph name</a>.</p>

    <p>A second graph could be provided by <a
    href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>
    and identified by
    <code>https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q12418</code>:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="Second graph in the sample dataset">
      &lt;Leonardo da Vinci&gt; &lt;is the creator of&gt; &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;.
      &lt;The video 'La Joconde à Washington'&gt; &lt;is about&gt; &lt;the Mona Lisa&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>Below is an example of an unnamed graph. It contains two triples that
    have the graph name <code>&lt;http://example.org/bob&gt;</code>
    as subject. The triples associate publisher and license information with
    this graph IRI: </p>

    <pre class="example" title="Unnamed graph in the sample dataset">
      &lt;http://example.org/bob&gt; &lt;is published by&gt; &lt;http://example.org&gt;.
      &lt;http://example.org/bob&gt; &lt;has license&gt; &lt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&gt;.
    </pre>

    <p> In this example dataset we assume graph
    names represent the source of the RDF data held within the
    corresponding graphs, i.e. by retrieving
    <code>&lt;http://example.org/bob&gt;</code> we would get access to the four triples
    in that graph.</p>

    <p class="note">RDF provides no standard way to convey this semantic
    assumption (i.e., that graph names represent the source of the
    RDF data) to other readers of the dataset. Those readers will
    need to rely on out-of-band knowledge, such as established
    community practice, to interpret the dataset
    in the intended way. Possible semantics of datasets are described in a separate note
    [[RDF11-DATASETS]]. </p>

  <h2>RDF Vocabularies</h2>

  <p>The RDF data model provides a way to make statements about
  resources. As we mentioned, this data model does not make any
  assumptions about what resource IRIs stand for. In practice, RDF
  is typically used in combination with vocabularies or other
  conventions that provide semantic information about these
  resources. </p>

  <p>To support the definition of vocabularies RDF provides
  the RDF Schema language
  [[RDF12-SCHEMA]]. This language allows one to define semantic
  characteristics of
  RDF data. For example, one can state that the IRI
  <code>http://www.example.org/friendOf</code> can be used as a property and that the
  subjects and objects of <code>http://www.example.org/friendOf</code> triples must be
  resources of class <code>http://www.example.org/Person</code>. <p>

  <p>RDF Schema uses the notion of <strong>class</strong> to
  specify categories that can be used to classify resources. The
  relation between an instance and its class is stated through the
  <strong>type</strong> property. With RDF Schema one can create hierarchies
  of classes and sub-classes and of
  properties and sub-properties. Type restrictions on the subjects
  and objects of particular triples can be defined through
  <strong>domain</strong> and <strong>range</strong>
  restrictions. An example of a domain restriction was given above:
  subjects of "friendOf"  triples should be of class "Person".</p>

  <p>The main modeling
  constructs provided by RDF Schema are summarized in the table below:</p>

  <table id="table-rdf-schema" class="numbered">
    <caption>RDF Schema Constructs</caption>
    <tbody>
      <tr>

        <td>range of <strong>P</strong> (a property) is <strong>C</strong> (a class)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p class="note">The syntactic triple form (second column) is in a prefix
  notation which is discussed in more detail in
  <a href="#section-graph-syntax" class="sectionRef"></a>.
  The fact that the constructs have two different prefixes
  (<code>rdf:</code> and <code>rdfs:</code>) is a somewhat annoying
  historical artefact, which is preserved for backward
  compatibility.</p>

  <p>With the help of RDF Schema one can build a model of RDF data. A
  simple informal example:</p>

  <pre class="example" title="RDF Schema triples (informal)" id="rdfs-example">
    &lt;Person&gt; &lt;<strong>type</strong>&gt; &lt;Class&gt;
    &lt;is a friend of&gt; &lt;<strong>type</strong>&gt; &lt;Property&gt;
    &lt;is a friend of&gt; &lt;<strong>domain</strong>&gt; &lt;Person&gt;
    &lt;is a friend of&gt; &lt;<strong>range</strong>&gt; &lt;Person&gt;
    &lt;is a good friend of&gt; &lt;<strong>subPropertyOf</strong>&gt; &lt;is a friend of&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>Note that, while <code>&lt;is a friend of&gt;</code> is a
  property typically used as the predicate of a triple (as it was in
  <a href="#example1">Example&nbsp;1</a>), properties like this are themselves resources that can be
  described by triples or provide values in the descriptions of other
  resources. In this example, <code>&lt;is a friend of&gt;</code> is the subject of triples
  that assign type, domain, and range values to it, and it is the object of
  a triple that describes something about the <code>&lt;is a good friend of&gt;</code>
  property.

  <p>One of the first RDF vocabularies used worldwide was the
  <a href="https://www.foaf-project.org/">"Friend of a Friend"</a> (FOAF)
  vocabulary for describing social networks. Other examples of RDF
  vocabularies are:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core</a></dt>
    <dd>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative maintains a metadata element
    set for describing a wide range of resources. The vocabulary provides
    properties such as "creator", "publisher" and "title".</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>
    <dd>Schema.org is a vocabulary developed by a group of major search
    providers. The idea is that webmasters can use these terms to mark-up
    Web pages, so that search engines understand what the pages are
    about.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS</a></dt>
    <dd>SKOS is a vocabulary for publishing classification schemes
    such as terminologies and thesauri on the Web. SKOS is since 2009 a W3C
    recommendation and is widely used in the library world. The Library of
    Congress published its Subject Headings as a <a
    href="https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html">SKOS
    vocabulary</a>.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Vocabularies get their value from reuse: the more vocabulary IRIs
  are reused by others, the more valuable it becomes to use the
  IRIs (the so-called network effect). This means you should prefer
  re-using someone else's IRI instead of inventing a new one. </p>

  <p>For a formal specification of the semantics of the RDF Schema
  constructs the reader is referred to
  the RDF Semantics document [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]. Users interested in more comprehensive
  semantic modeling of RDF data might consider using OWL
  [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. OWL is an RDF vocabulary, so it can be
  used in combination with RDF Schema.</p>

  <h2>Writing RDF graphs</h2>

  <p>A number of different serialization formats exist for writing down RDF
    graphs. However, different ways of writing down the same graph lead
    to exactly the same triples, and are thus logically equivalent. </p>

  <p>In this section we briefly introduce, through annotated examples, the following formats:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Turtle family of RDF languages
      (<a href="#section-n-triples">N-Triples</a>,
       <a href="#section-turtle">Turtle</a>,

    basic concepts for serializing RDF. We suggest you

  <section id="section-turtle-family">
    <h3>Turtle family of RDF languages</h3>

    <p>In this subsection we introduce four RDF languages
    which are closely related. We start with N-Triples, as it provides
    basic syntax for writing down RDF triples. The Turtle syntax
    extends this basic syntax with various forms of syntactic sugar to improve
    readability. Subsequently we discuss TriG and N-Quads, which are
    extensions respectively of Turtle and
    N-Triples to encode multiple graphs. Together, these four are
    referred to as the "Turtle family of RDF languages".</p>

    <section id="section-n-triples">
      <h4>N-Triples</h4>

      <p>N-Triples [[RDF12-N-TRIPLES]]  provides a simple line-based, plain-text way for serializing RDF
      graphs. The informal graph in <a
      href="#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> can be represented in N-Triples in the
      following way:</p>

      <pre class="example" title="N-Triples" id="n-triples-example">
        <span class="linenum">01</span>    &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt; .
        <span class="linenum">02</span>    &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt; &lt;http://example.org/alice#me&gt; .
        <span class="linenum">03</span>    &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/birthDate&gt; "1990-07-04"^^&lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#date&gt; .
        <span class="linenum">04</span>    &lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/topic_interest&gt; &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12418&gt; .
        <span class="linenum">05</span>    &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12418&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/title&gt; "Mona Lisa" .
        <span class="linenum">06</span>    &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12418&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator&gt; &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci&gt; .
        <span class="linenum">07</span>    &lt;http://data.europeana.eu/item/04802/243FA8618938F4117025F17A8B813C5F9AA4D619&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject&gt; &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12418&gt; .
      </pre>

      <p>Each line represents a triple. Full IRIs are enclosed in angle brackets
      (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>). The period at the end of the line signals the
      end of the triple. In line 3 we see an example of a literal, in this case a date. The
      datatype is appended to the literal through a <code>^^</code> delimiter. The date
      representation follows the conventions of the XML Schema datatype
      <a data-cite="XMLSCHEMA11-2#date">date</a>.</p>

      <p>Because string literals are so ubiquitous N-Triples allows the user to
      omit the datatype when writing a string literal. Thus, <code>"Mona
      Lisa"</code> in line 5 is equivalent to
      <code>"Mona Lisa"^^xsd:string</code>.
      In case of language-tagged strings the tag
      appears directly after the string, separated by a <code>@</code>
      symbol, e.g. <code>"La Joconde"@fr</code> (the French name of the Mona
      Lisa).</p>

      <p class="note">For technical reasons the datatype of language-tagged
      strings is not <code>xsd:string</code> but
      <code>rdf:langString</code>. The
      datatype of language-tagged strings is never specified explicitly.</p>

      <p>The figure below shows the triples resulting from the example:</p>

      <figure id="fig5">

                  alt="Graph of the sample triples">
        <figcaption>RDF graph resulting from the N-Triples example</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Note that the seven lines in the N-Triples example correspond to the seven
        arcs in the diagram above.</p>

      <p>N-Triples is often used for exchanging large amounts of RDF and for
      processing large RDF graphs with line-oriented text processing
      tools. </p>

    <section id="section-turtle">
      <h4>Turtle</h4>

      <p>Turtle [[RDF12-TURTLE]] is an <strong>extension of N-Triples</strong>.
      In addition to the basic N-Triples syntax, Turtle
      introduces a number of syntactic shortcuts, such as
      support for namespace prefixes, lists and shorthands for datatyped
      literals. Turtle provides a trade-off between ease of
      writing, ease of parsing and readability. The graph shown in
      <a href="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a> can be
      represented in Turtle as follows:</p>

      <pre class="example" title="Turtle" id="turtle-example">

        <span class="linenum">12</span>        foaf:topic_interest wd:Q12418 .
        <span class="linenum">13</span>

        <span class="linenum">19</span>        dcterms:subject wd:Q12418 .
      </pre>

      <p>The Turtle example is logically equivalent to the <a href="#n-triples-example">N-Triples</a>
      example. Lines 1-6 contain a number of directives which provide shorthands for
      writing down IRIs. Relative IRIs (such as <code>bob#me</code> on line 8) are
      resolved against a base IRI, specified here in line 1.
      Lines 2-6 define IRI prefixes (such as <code>foaf:</code>), which  can
      be used for prefixed names (such as <code>foaf:Person</code>) instead of full IRIs.
      The corresponding IRI is constructed by replacing the prefix with its
      corresponding IRI (in this example <code>foaf:Person</code> stands for
      <code>&lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt;</code>).</p>

      <p>Lines 8-12 show how Turtle provides a shorthand for a set of
      triples with the same subject. Lines 9-12 specify the predicate-object
      part of triples that have <code>&lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt;</code> as
      their subject. The semicolons at the end of lines 9-11 indicate that
      the predicate-object pair that follows it is part of
      a new triple that uses the most recent subject shown in the data &#8212; in
      this case <code>bob#me</code>. </p>

      <p>Line 9 shows an example of a special kind of syntactic sugar. The triple
      should informally be read as "Bob (is) a Person". The
      <code>a</code> predicate
      is a shorthand for the property <code>rdf:type</code> which models the
      instance relation (see <a href="#table-rdf-schema">Table 1</a>).
      The <code>a</code> shorthand is intended to match the human
      intuition about <code>rdf:type</code>. </p>

      <section id="section-blank-node-representation">
        <h5>Representation of blank nodes</h5>

        <p>Below we see two syntactic variants for writing down blank nodes, using the
          earlier cypress tree example.</p>

        <pre class="example" title="Blank node">
          PREFIX lio: &lt;http://purl.org/net/lio#&gt;

          &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mona_Lisa&gt; lio:shows _:x .
          _:x a &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cypress&gt; .
        </pre>

        <p>The term <code>_:x</code> is a blank node. It represents an
        unnamed resource depicted in
        the Mona Lisa painting; the unnamed resource is an instance of the
        <code>Cypress</code> class. The example above provides concrete syntax
        for the informal graph in <a href="#fig2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>.</p>

        <p>Turtle also has an alternative notation for blank nodes, which
        does not require the use of syntax like <code>_:x</code>: </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Blank nodes (alternative notation)">
          @prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt; .
          @prefix dcterms: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/&gt; .

          # entitled "Mona Lisa" and created by Leonardo da Vinci.

          [] foaf:topic_interest [

                    dcterms:creator &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci&gt; ] .
        </pre>

        <p>Square brackets represent here a blank node. Predicate-object pairs within
        the square brackets are interpreted as triples with the blank node as
        subject. Lines starting with '#' represent
        comments. </p>
      </section>

      <section id="section-turtle-reifier-representation">
        <h5>Representations of reifying triples</h5>

        <p>Turtle provides a concise notation for reifying and annotating
        triples. This allows us to encode the example in the section about <a
        href="#section-triple-terms">triple terms</a>, where the simple fact
        that Bob is interested in the Mona Lisa was annotated with a more
        specific circumstance.</p>

        <p>We can use an unnamed annotation to state when the interest itself
        began:</p>
        <pre class="example turtle" title="Unnamed annotation"
             data-include="example-unnamed-annotation.ttl"
             data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>We can also describe that Alice has once made the simple claim. Here
        we use the syntax of a reifying triple, which references it without
        implying its truth:</p>
        <pre class="example turtle" title="Unnamed reifier"
             data-include="example-unnamed-reifier.ttl"
             data-include-format="text">
        </pre>

        <p>The previous two descriptions can also be combined, as two
        annotations on one statement. Here we also identify the reifiers with
        IRIs:</p>
        <pre class="example turtle" title="Named annotations"
             data-include="example-named-annotations.ttl"

    <section id="section-trig">
      <h4>TriG</h4>

      <p>The syntax of Turtle supports only the specification of single

      <p>This RDF dataset contains two named graphs. Lines 8 and 17 list
      the names of these two graphs. The triples in the named graph are
      placed in between matching curly braces (lines 9 &amp; 15, 18 &amp;
      25). Optionally you can precede the graph name with the keyword
      <code>GRAPH</code>. This may improve readability, but it is mainly
      introduced for alignment with SPARQL Update [[SPARQL12-UPDATE]]. </p>

      <p>The syntax of the triples and of the directives at the top conforms to
      the Turtle syntax.</p>

      <p>The two triples specified on lines 27-29 are not part of any
      named graph. Together they form the unnamed ("default") graph of this RDF
      dataset.</p>

      <p>The figure below shows the triples resulting from this example.</p>

      <p>N-Quads [[RDF12-N-QUADS]] is a simple extension to N-Triples to enable the exchange of RDF
      datasets. N-Quads allows one to add a fourth element to a line, capturing

      <p>The nine lines in the N-Quads example correspond to the nine
      arcs in <a href="#fig6">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>. Lines 1-7 represent quads, where the last
      element constitutes the graph IRI. The part of the quad before the
      graph IRI specifies the
      subject, predicate and object of the statement, following the syntactic
      conventions of N-Triples. Lines 8 and 9 represent the statements in the unnamed (default)
      graph, which lack a fourth element and thus constitute regular triples. </p>

      <p><p>Like N-Triples, N-Quads is typically used for exchanging large RDF datasets and for
      processing RDF with line-oriented text processing tools. </p>

    <h3>JSON-LD</h3>

    <p>JSON-LD [[JSON-LD11]]
    provides a JSON syntax for RDF graphs and datasets.
    JSON-LD can be used to transform JSON documents to RDF with
    minimal changes. JSON-LD offers universal identifiers for
    JSON objects, a mechanism in which a JSON document can refer to
    an object described in another JSON document elsewhere on the
    Web, as well as datatype and language handling. JSON-LD
    also provides a way to serialize RDF datasets
    through the use of the
    <a data-cite="JSON-LD11#named-graphs">@graph</a> keyword.</p>

    <p>The following JSON-LD example encodes the graph of <a
      href="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>:</p>

    <pre class="example" title="JSON-LD">
      <span class="linenum">01</span>    {
      <span class="linenum">02</span>      "@context": "example-context.json",
      <span class="linenum">03</span>      "@id": "http://example.org/bob#me",
      <span class="linenum">04</span>      "@type": "Person",
      <span class="linenum">05</span>      "birthdate": "1990-07-04",
      <span class="linenum">06</span>      "knows": "http://example.org/alice#me",
      <span class="linenum">07</span>      "interest": {
      <span class="linenum">08</span>        "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q12418",
      <span class="linenum">09</span>        "title": "Mona Lisa",
      <span class="linenum">10</span>        "subject_of": "http://data.europeana.eu/item/04802/243FA8618938F4117025F17A8B813C5F9AA4D619",
      <span class="linenum">11</span>        "creator": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci"
      <span class="linenum">12</span>      }
      <span class="linenum">13</span>    }
    </pre>

    <p>The <code>@context</code> key on line 2
    points to a JSON document
    describing how the document can be mapped to an RDF graph (see below).
    Each JSON object corresponds to an RDF resource. In this example
    the main resource being described is
    <code>http://example.org/bob#me</code>, as
    specified on line 3, through the use of the <code>@id</code> keyword.
    The <code>@id</code> keyword, when used as a key in a JSON-LD document, points
    to an IRI identifying the resource corresponding to the current JSON object.
    We describe the type of this resource on line 4, its birth date
    on line 5 and one of its friends on line 6. From line 7 to 12 we describe
    one of its interests, the Mona Lisa painting.</p>

    <p>To describe this painting we create a
    new JSON object on line 7 and associate it with the Mona Lisa IRI in Wikidata
    on line 8. We then describe various properties of that painting
    from line 9 to line 11. </p>

    <p>The JSON-LD context used in this example is given below.</p>

    <pre class="example" title="JSON-LD context specification">

      <span class="linenum">24</span>      }
      <span class="linenum">25</span>    }
    </pre>

    <p>This context describes how a JSON-LD document can be mapped
    to an RDF graph. Lines 4 to 9 specify how to map
    <code>Person</code>, <code>interest</code> and <code>knows</code>
    to types and properties in the FOAF namespace defined
    on line 3. We also specify on line 8 that the <code>knows</code>
    key has a value that will be interpreted as an IRI, through
    the use of the <code>@type</code> and <code>@id</code> keywords.</p>

    <p>From line 10 to line 12 we map <code>birthdate</code> to
    a schema.org property IRI and specify that its value can
    be mapped to an <code>xsd:date</code> datatype. </p>

    <p>From line 14 to line 23 we describe how to map
    <code>title</code>, <code>creator</code> and <code>subject_of</code>
    to Dublin Core property IRIs. The <code>@reverse</code>
    keyword on line 21 is used to specify that, whenever we
    encounter <code>"subject_of": "x"</code> in a JSON-LD document using this
    context, we should map it to an RDF triple which subject is the <code>x</code>
    IRI, which property is <code>dcterms:subject</code> and
    which object is the resource corresponding to the parent JSON object.</p>

    <h3>RDFa</h3>

    <p>RDFa [[RDFA-PRIMER]] is an RDF syntax that  can be used to embed RDF data within
    HTML and XML documents. This enables, for example, search engines to aggregate
    this data when crawling the Web and use it to enrich search
    results (see, e.g., <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a>
    and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets">Rich
    Snippets</a>). </p>

    <p>The HTML example below encodes the
    RDF graph depicted in <a href="#fig5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>:</p>

      <span class="linenum">24</span>    &lt;/div&gt;
      <span class="linenum">25</span>  &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>The example above contains four special RDFa attributes to enable
    specification of RDF triples within HTML: <code>resource</code>,
    <code>property</code>, <code>typeof</code> and <code>prefix</code>.<p>

    <p>The <code>prefix</code> attribute in line 1 specifies IRI
    shorthands in a similar fashion as the Turtle prefixes. Strictly
    speaking, these particular prefixes could have been omitted, as RDFa has a
    list of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/rdfa-context/rdfa-1.1">predefined
    prefixes</a> which includes the ones used in this example.</p>

    <p>The <code>div</code> elements in lines 4 and 14 have a <code>resource</code>
    attribute specifying the IRI about which RDF statements can be
    made within this HTML element. The meaning of the <code>typeof</code>
    attribute in line 4 is similar to the <code>(is) a</code> shorthand in
    Turtle: the subject <code>http://example.org/bob#me</code> is an
    instance (<code>rdf:type</code>) of the class <code>foaf:Person</code>.<p>

    <p>In line 6 we see a <code>property</code> attribute; the value
    of this attribute (<code>foaf:knows</code>) is interpreted as an RDF
    property IRI; the value of the <code>href</code> attribute
    (<code>http://example.org/alice#me</code>) is
    interpreted here as the object of the triple. Thus, the RDF statement
    that results from line 6 is:<p>

    <pre>
      <code>&lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt; &lt;http://example.org/alice#me&gt; .</code>
    </pre>

    <p>In line 7 we see a triple with as object a literal value. The
    <code>property</code> attribute is specified here on the HTML
    <code>time</code> element. HTML requires that the content of the time
    element should be some valid
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-time-element">time value</a>.
    By using the built-in HTML semantics of the
    <code>time</code> element RDFa can interpret
    the value as an <code>xsd:date</code> without an explicit datatype declaration.<p>

    <p>In lines 10-11 we see the <code>resource</code> attribute also being used for
    specifying the object of a triple. This approach is used when the object is an
    IRI and the IRI itself is not part of the HTML content (such as an <code>href</code>
    attribute). Line 16 contains a second example of a literal ("Mona
    Lisa"), defined here as content of the <code>span</code> attribute. If
    RDFa cannot infer the datatype of the literal, it will assume the
    datatype to be <code>xsd:string</code>. </p>

    <p>It is not always possible to define RDF statements as part of the
    HTML content of the document. In that case it is possible to use HTML
    constructs that do not render content to specify a triple. An example
    can be found on lines 22-23. The HTML <code>link</code> element on
    line 23 is used here to specify what
    the subject of the Europeana video (line 22) is. </p>

    <p>The use of RDFa in this example is limited to RDFa Lite
    [[RDFA-LITE]]. For more information about RDFa please consult the RDFa
    Primer [[RDFA-PRIMER]].</p>

    <h3>RDF/XML</h3>

    <p>RDF/XML [[RDF12-XML]] provides an XML syntax for RDF
    graphs. When RDF was originally developed in the late 1990s, this was its
    only syntax, and some people still call this syntax "RDF". In 2001, a
    precursor to Turtle called "N3" was proposed, and gradually the other
    languages listed here have been adopted and standardized. </p>

    <p>In RDF/XML RDF triples are specified within an XML element
    <code>rdf:RDF</code> (lines 2 and 20). The attributes of the
    <code>rdf:RDF</code> start tag (lines 3-6) provide a shorthand for writing down
    names of XML elements and attributes. The XML element
    <code>rdf:Description</code> (short for
    <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#Description</code>)
    is used to define sets of triples that have as subject the IRI
    specified by the <code>about</code> attribute.  The first description
    block (line 7-12) has four sub-elements. The name of the subelement is
    an IRI representing an RDF property, e.g., <code>rdf:type</code> (line 8). Here, each
    subelement represents one triple.
    In cases where the object of the triple is also an IRI
    the property subelement has no content and the object IRI is specified
    using the <code>rdf:resource</code> attribute (lines 8, 10-11, 15 and
    18). For example, line 10 corresponds to the triple:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>&lt;http://example.org/bob#me&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows&gt; &lt;http://example.org/alice#me&gt; .</code>
    </pre>

    <p>When the object of the
    triple is a literal the literal value is entered as content of the
    property element (lines 9 and 14). The datatype is specified as
    attribute of the property element (line 9). If the datatype is
    omitted (line 14) and no language tag is present the literal is
    considered to have the datatype <code>xsd:string</code>.

    <p>The example shows the baseline syntax; please consult the RDF/XML
    document [[RDF12-XML]] for a more in-depth treatment of the syntax. It
    might seem strange that the attribute values contain full IRIs,
    despite the fact that for some of these namespace prefixes were
    defined. This is because these prefixes can only be used for XML
    element and attribute names. </p>

  <h2>Semantics of RDF Graphs</h2>

  <p>An overarching goal in the use of RDF is to be able to
  automatically merge useful information from multiple sources to
  form a larger collection that is still coherent and useful. As a
  starting point for this merging, all the information is conveyed
  in the same simple style, subject-predicate-object triples, as
  described above. To keep the information coherent, however, we
  need more than just a standard syntax; we also need agreement
  about the semantics of these triples. </p>

  <p>By this point in the Primer, the reader is likely to have an
  intuitive grasp of the semantics of RDF:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The IRIs used to name the subject, predicate, and object are "global" in scope,
  naming the same thing each time they are used.</li>
    <li>Each triple is "true" exactly when the predicate relation actually exists between
  the subject and the object.</li>
    <li>An RDF graph is "true" exactly when all the triples in it are "true".</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These notions,
  and others, are specified with mathematical precision in the RDF
  Semantics document [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]].</p>

  <p>One of the benefits of RDF having these declarative semantics
  is that systems can make logical inferences. That is, given a
  certain set of input triples which they accept as true, systems
  can in some circumstances deduce that other triples must,
  logically, also be true. We say the first set of triples "entails"
  the additional triples. These systems, called "reasoners", can also
  sometimes deduce that the given input triples contradict each
  other.</p>

  <p>Given the flexibility of RDF, where new vocabularies can be
  created when people want to use new concepts, there are many
  different kinds of reasoning one might want to do.  When a
  specific kind of reasoning seems to be useful in many different
  applications, it can be documented as an <a data-cite="RDF12-SEMANTICS#entailment-regime">entailment regime</a>.
  Several entailment regimes are specified in RDF Semantics.
  For technical descriptions of some other entailment regimes and how to
  use these with SPARQL, see [[SPARQL12-ENTAILMENT]].
  Note that some
  entailment regimes are fairly easy to implement and reasoning can
  be done quickly, while others require sophisticated
  techniques to implement efficiently. </p>

  <p>As a sample entailment, consider the following two statements:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>ex:bob foaf:knows ex:alice .</code>
    <code>foaf:knows rdfs:domain foaf:Person .</code>
  </pre>
  <p>The RDF Semantics document tell us that from this graph it is legal to
  derive the following triple:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>ex:bob rdf:type foaf:Person .</code>
  </pre>

  <p>The derivation above is an example of an RDF Schema entailment [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]]. </p>

  <p>The semantics of RDF also tell us that the triple:</p>

 <pre>
   <code>ex:bob ex:age "forty"^^xsd:integer . </code>
 </pre>

  <p>leads to a logical inconsistency, because the literal does not
  abide by the constraints defined for the XML Schema datatype
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#integer">integer</a>.</p>

  <p>Note that RDF tools may not recognize all datatypes. As a
  minimum, tools are required to support the datatypes for string literals
  and language-tagged literals.</p>

  <p>Unlike many other data
  modeling languages, RDF Schema allows considerable modeling
  freedom. For example, the same entity may be used
  as both a class and a property. Also, there is no strict separation
  between the world of "classes" and of "instances". Therefore, RDF
  semantics views the following graph as valid:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>ex:Jumbo rdf:type ex:Elephant .</code>
    <code>ex:Elephant rdf:type ex:Species .</code>
  </pre>

   <p>So, an elephant can both be a class (with Jumbo as a sample
   instance) and an instance (namely of the class of
   animal species).</p>

  <p>The examples in this section are just meant to give the reader
    some feeling about what the RDF Semantics brings you. Please consult
    [[RDF12-SEMANTICS]] for a complete description.</p>

  <h2>RDF Data</h2>

  <p>RDF allows you to combine triples from any source into a graph
  and process it as legal RDF. A large amount of RDF data is
  available as Linked
  Data [[LINKED-DATA]]. Datasets are being published and
  interlinked on the Web using RDF, and many of them offer a
  querying facility through SPARQL [[SPARQL12-CONCEPTS]]. Examples
  of such datasets used in the examples above include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>, a free,
    collaborative, and multilingual database run by the
    <a href="https://www.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="https://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, publishing data extracted
    from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Infobox">Wikipedia infoboxes</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2006/03/wn/wn20/">WordNet</a>,
    a lexical database of English terms, grouped in sets
    of synonyms, with a range of semantic interrelations. Similar
    databases exist for other languages.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.europeana.eu/">Europeana</a>, publishing
    data about cultural objects from a large number of European
    institutions.</li>

    <li><a href="https://viaf.org/">VIAF</a>, publishing data about
    people, works and geographic places from a number of national
    libraries and other agencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A list of datasets available as Linked Data is maintained at
  <a href="https://datahub.io/dataset">datahub.io</a>.</p>

  <P>A number of vocabulary terms have become popular for
  recording links between RDF data sources. An example is the
  <code>sameAs</code> property provided by the OWL vocabulary. This
  property can be used to indicate that two IRIs point in fact
  to the same resource. This is useful because different publishers
  may use different identifiers to denote the same thing. For
  example, VIAF (see above) also has an IRI denoting Leonardo da
  Vinci. With the help of <code>owl:sameAs</code> we can record this
  information:</p>

  <pre class="example" title="Link between datasets">
  &lt;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leonardo_da_Vinci&gt;
      owl:sameAs &lt;http://viaf.org/viaf/24604287/&gt; .
  </pre>

  <p>Such links can be deployed by RDF data-processing
  software, for example by merging or comparing RDF data of
  IRIs that point to the same resource. </p>
